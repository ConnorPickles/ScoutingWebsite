            A group of Ventures is called a company. This is because the company has regular meetings, as well as an executive. This executive always consists of 4 positions; the president, the vice-president, the treasurer, and the secretary. Members of the company are elected into these positions by their peers. Some groups may create extra positions, depending on what the group does and how many people are in the group. I will now go over the responsibilities of the four main positions, as stated in my company&rsquo;s by-laws:
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>President</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Be responsible for the preparation of the overall program and the agenda for meetings;</li>
                <li>Preside over the Company and Executive Council meetings and shall, in due course, ensure that parliamentary procedures are followed as closely as possible;</li>
                <li>If not willing to accept the role of the Group Youth Commissioner, this position will be elected by the company for approval by the Group Commissioner.<br />

            </ul>
            <strong>Vice-President</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Be responsible for the recruiting and briefing of all new and prospective members of the Company</li>
            </ul>
